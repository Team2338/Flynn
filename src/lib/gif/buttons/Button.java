/**
 * This class provides an easy way to link commands to OI inputs.
 *
 * It is very easy to link a button to a command. For instance, you could link
 * the trigger button of a joystick to a "score" command.
 *
 * This class represents a subclass of Trigger that is specifically aimed at
 * buttons on an operator interface as a common use case of the more generalized
 * Trigger objects. This is a simple wrapper around Trigger with the method
 * names renamed to fit the Button object use.
